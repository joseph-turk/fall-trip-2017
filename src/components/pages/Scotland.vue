      We spent most of the trip in Scotland, starting and ending in Edinburgh with a tour of the highlands in between.

    <country-subheading>Edinburgh to Oban</country-subheading>

    <country-content dropCap="true">
      We took a 6:50 AM flight from Belfast to Edinburgh. Our goal was to get to Scotland as cheaply as possible, so we took a budget airline, meaning our plane was a propeller plane rather than a jet, and we had to get on from stairs on the tarmac rather than a jet bridge.

      When we got in to Edinburgh, we picked up our rental car at the airport. The car was nicer than we expected it to be, but driving on the wrong side of the road was exactly as disorienting as we expected it to be. And the weirdest part of the car, which we weren't expecting, was that it turned off whenever it stopped. So when we stopped at an intersection, it felt like the car stalled.

      We drove from Edinburgh to Stirling to take a tour of the castle there. The castle has been added on to and continuously used since around 800. It was huge and took a couple hours to walk around.

      We then drove from Stirling to Oban, stopping every once in a while to take in the sights. The countryside was beautiful—like a mix of Iceland and Colorado. There were no snow-capped mountains, but everything was covered in golden grass, moss, and ferns, and there were streams, lakes, and waterfalls everywhere.

      The drive on the first day with the car was really difficult. Driving on the left is one thing, but the roads are also narrow and winding. For much of the drive, there was a hard curb on the left side of the road with no shoulder in between. It took a lot of effort and thought to find the appropriate place in the lane to not go into oncoming traffic but also not run into the curb.

    <country-content>
      We spent Saturday night in Oban. Our guest house was a little outside the main area of town, but we walked up to a lookout with great views of the harbor and then down into town to get dinner.

      Saturday was also Alison's birthday, so we wanted to do something special for dinner! We found a restaurant was crowded—we took that as a good sign for the food—and looked out on the ocean. It was charmingly Scottish, and the host asked us to take a "wee seat at the bar" when there wasn't a table for us right away. The main courses were good, but the real treat was getting sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It was bitter and sweet and paired perfectly with a local Scotch.

    <country-subheading>Inverness</country-subheading>

    <country-content dropCap="true">
      On Sunday, we drove from Oban up to Inverness. Most of the drive was along the shore of Loch Ness, which was beautiful. We took our time and stopped several times to enjoy the scenery. On one of our stops, we pulled into a parking area and found a trail that led down to a river. It wasn't raining, so we explored for a while and took advantage of the nice weather.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      Inverness is quite a bit bigger than Oban, but it's still a small city. We stayed at a hotel right on the bank of the River Ness. It had several buildings, all of which were Victorian townhouses and apartments.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      We were craving something different from the pub food that we had been eating so much of to this point on the trip, so went out for pizza in Inverness. Our fig and prosciutto pizza was really good and reminded us of one that we'd gotten in Boston a couple years ago. After dinner, we stopped in at the hotel bar and tried a couple whiskies. We both agreed that the Talisker 10 was our favorite. And it was cheap—less than &pound;3!

    <country-subheading>Skye</country-subheading>

    <country-content dropCap="true">
      We drove from Inverness to the Isle of Skye on Monday. Again, the countryside was breathtaking, and we stopped often. It rained off and on all day, but we still made the most of time out of the car.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      Soon after we crossed over onto Skye, we stopped at a wildlife hide and otter refuge. We had to drive about 30 minutes up a single-lane mountainside road to get there. The drive was challenging, but traffic was minimal and it was a really unique, awesome experience. After we parked, we walked down to the shelter where we saw a heron, some seals, and an otter from a distance.

    <country-content>
      We stayed at a B&amp;B on Skye, and it was a very pleasant change from the previous nights. It was clean and modern, with white linen and light wood. For dinner, we walked in to Portree and stopped in at a cafe for really good fish and chips and a burger. We also tried beers from the local Isle of Skye Brewing Company, which were delicious.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      Our second day on Skye was at a more relaxed pace. We had breakfast at the B&amp;B and then headed out to see some of the sights on the island. We started with a hike up near a rock called the Old Man of Storr. The views were incredible and the wind and rain almost just added to the experience.

    <country-content>
      For another stop along the way, we went through a scenic drive that had a stopoff about halfway through with a hiking trail. The road was only one lane with passing places—similar to the drive up to the otter refuge the day before—but this time there was a lot of traffic. With all the rain, the shoulders of the road were also quite muddy, and a bunch of cars had driven off the sides and got stuck. The drive was stressful, but luckily we didn't run into any issues.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      For dinner we went to Loch Bay, an amazing restaurant on the other side of the island. It was in a very remote location right on the ocean, with seafood traps piled in the parking lot and sheep grazing nearby. The atmosphere inside was cozy, and the food was some of the best we've ever had. We even found out afterward that they had been awarded a Michelin star just one day earlier!
    </country-content>

    <photo-with-caption id="138"/>

    <country-content>
      The drive back from dinner was nerve-wracking. It was pitch black, rainy, and windy, and there were no street lights for most of the drive. Plus, the first few miles were (again) one-lane roads with passing places.
    </country-content>

    <country-subheading>Edinburgh</country-subheading>

    <country-content dropCap="true">
      We drove from Skye back to Edinburgh on Wednesday. It was the longest day of driving we did the whole trip—about five hours if we hadn't stopped. Just before crossing from the Isle of Skye back to the Scottish mainland, we stopped off to see some highland cows that were close up to the fence at the side of the road.
    </country-content>

    <photo-with-caption id="144"/>

    <country-content>
      Everything went OK on the drive, but both of us could feel the tension mounting as we got closer to returning the car. But the return went smoothly, and we felt relieved to no longer have the car.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      Edinburgh was rainy for most of the time we were there, so we didn't spend much time exploring the city. We did, however, stop in to the public library on the way to dinner, and it was really cool. Alison immediately saw ideas that she's been trying to incorporate into the renovation design for her library. She even got a chance to talk with their children's librarian briefly about when their space was last redone.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      For dinner, we went to a touristy whisky bar. The food was just OK, but the whisky was good, and we did a tasting flight of Islay malts, which are generally the smokiest of all the types of Scotch.
    </country-content>

    <country-content>
      Scotland was incredible, and renting a car was the perfect way to experience it. We had the freedom to take things at our own pace and stop to explore whenever we saw something that looked cool. For our first time renting a car in a foreign country, it really couldn't have gone better.
